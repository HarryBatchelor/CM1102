	Sir Clive Marles Sinclair was born 30<sup>th</sup> July 1940 in Richmond, London, England to parents George and Thora Sinclair.
	He is an entrepreneur and inventor. His most famous work came in the late 1970s
	and early 1980s in the consumer electronic industry.
	<br/>
	In 1961 he founded Sinclair Radionics where, in 1972, he made the Sinclair Executive,
	which is the first slim-line electronic pocket calculator. He later went onto produce
	the Sinclair ZX80 which was the UK's first mass-market home computer for less than &pound;100.
	Later on, he founded Sinclair Research which went onto produce the ZX81 and the ZX Spectrum.
	<br/>
	The ZX81 is often recognised as an important stepping stone in the early days of the British home computer industry
	<br/>
	As part Sinclair Research he also produced the TV80 which is a mini portable flatscreen
	TV which uses cathode ray tubes, however, at the time of relase LCD technology was in advanced development and so
	the TV80 was a commercial flop with only 15,000 units being produced.
	<br/>
	After his knighting in 1983, Sinclair founded Sinclair Vehicles which relased the Sinclair C5,
	which was a battery powered vehicle. The C5 was also a commercial failure. Since the C5
	Sinclair has been focusing on personal transport, including the A-bike, which is a folding bike for commuters
	that weighs 5.5 Kg and can fold down small enough to be carried on public transport.
