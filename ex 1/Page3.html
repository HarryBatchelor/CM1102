<p>
	Sir Clive Sinclair's only real contribution that was held a legacy is the ZX spectrum
	This was the home computer which kickstarted the home computing revolution in the UK and beyond.
	The spectrum was so important that people are selling recreated versions on online marketplaces such as Amazon.
	The ZX spectrum also had a hugh part of in the PC gaming world. The spectrum had hundres of games released for it.
	Some of the most notable games were titles such as Manic miner and Football manager. Football manger has gone on to be a
	large franchise realsing a game every year.
	<br/>
	Sinclair also released, in 1985, the Sinclair C5. This was a pedal assisted electric cycle. The C5 was released well before it's time.
	In the last few years the rise in electric assited pedal cycles has sky rocketed. If the C5 was released closer to 2018 than 1985 it would have been very popular
	rather than the flop that it was.
