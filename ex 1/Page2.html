<p>
Sir Clive Sinclair's first major contribution to the world of technology came in 1972 in with the Sinclair Executive.
The Executive was the first slim-line electronic pocket calculator. He also had future success
with the ZX80, the UK's first home computer for less than &pound;100. The ZX80 was released in 1980
selling 100,000 units only to be discontinued in 1981.
<br/>
after moving to Sinclair Research, he produced the ZX81 and the ZX Spectrum. These two machines
were Sinclair's biggest success. The ZX81 sold over 1.5 million units after being on sale for only 3 years from 1981-1984.
The ZX Spectrum sold even more. The spectrum sold over 5 million copies being on sale for 10 years, from 1982-1992.
The Spectrum is often considered as the computer that ignited the home computer age in the UK and beyond.
<br/>
This is where Sinclair's success ended. He went onto produce miniature TV's and also a few personal transport vehicles which all flopped
